# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is taken seriously.  If you discover a vulnerability in OpenFIVS or any of its dependencies, please report it privately.

* **Email:** security@openfivs.example.org (replace with actual contact)
* **PGP:** [security key fingerprint TBD]

Please include a description of the issue, steps to reproduce and, if possible, a proof of concept.  We aim to respond to security reports within **72 hours**.  If the report is confirmed, we will work with you to resolve the issue and publish an advisory.

## Supported Versions

At this early stage, only the latest commit on the `main` branch is maintained.  If a security issue affects released versions, we will backport fixes where feasible.
