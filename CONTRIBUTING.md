## Contributing to OpenFIVS

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  The goal of OpenFIVS is to build an open, federated platform for immersive virtual spaces.  We welcome code patches, bug reports, documentation improvements and feature proposals.

### Getting started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork locally.
2. Create a new branch for your change: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`.
3. Make your changes, following the existing coding style.  Run `npm install` and `npm test` where appropriate.
4. Commit your changes with clear commit messages.
5. Push your branch and open a **pull request** against the `main` branch.

### Code style

We strive for readable, maintainable code.  Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript) and descriptive variable names.  Keep functions small and focused.  Where possible, add comments describing nonâ€‘obvious logic.

### Reporting issues

If you encounter a bug or have a question, please open an issue on GitHub.  Provide as much detail as possible:

* Steps to reproduce
* Expected behaviour
* Actual behaviour
* Environment (browser version, Node.js version, OS)
